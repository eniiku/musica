# Musica
Think of it as a Spotify clone, only different. 

## Overview
Musica is a web development project designed to captivate music lovers, celebrates all genres, artists, and musical expressions. and deliver an immersive online experience. 

For this project I took a Figma design and converted it into pixel perfect representation on the web. All content were rendered dynamically from an API. This include short clips of top ranking music in the world (updated periodically). 

The website's robust and scalable architecture ensures smooth performance even under high traffic loads, delivering a flawless experience to users. This project integrates with external media storage and utilizes performance optimization techniques such as code minification, caching, and image optimization to ensure the website delivers an exceptional experience to visitors.
